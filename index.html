 <p>My name is Leeza. I'm a biologist by day and student by night. This blog is created to capture my progress on becoming Data Analyst. 
   It is beginning of February 2019 and I signed up myself for UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics/Visualization Boot Camp. 
   This is my second boot camp I'm taking. My first boot camp experience was attending introduction to programming with 
   Hackbright Academy in San Francisco in March 2017. After that I took some more classes on Python, SQL and Big Data at 
   College of San Mateo, CA.</p>

 <p>My day job involves mostly wet bench work at small biotech company in Mountain View, CA. At Cellecta, Inc. we offer pooled 
   lentiviral shRNA and CRISPR libraries, pooled library screening and analysis by NGS, targeted RNA-Seq for biomarker discovery, 
   lentiviral reagents, and stable cDNA, shRNA, and CRISPR constructs and isogenic cell lines. My current title is Research Associate, 
   where I'm responsible for running daily experiments associated with shRNA and CRISPR constructs and actually making them. 
   Joining bioinformatics team would be the ultimate goal of my boot camp journey!</p>
